    <h2 >What is NPS ?</h2>
   <p class="eqfont">
   The National Pension Scheme is a social security initiative by the Central Government. 
   This pension programme is open to employees from the public, private and even the unorganised 
   sectors except those from the armed forces. 
    <br><br>
    The scheme encourages people to invest in a pension account at regular intervals during the course 
    of their employment. After retirement, the subscribers can take out a certain percentage of the corpus. 
    As an NPS account holder, you will receive the remaining amount as a monthly pension post your retirement. <br><br>

      Earlier, the NPS scheme covered only the Central Government employees. Now, however, the PFRDA has made it open
       to all Indian citizens on a voluntary basis. <br><br>

      NPS scheme holds immense value for anyone who works in the private sector and requires a regular pension 
      after retirement. The scheme is portable across jobs and locations,
       with tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 80CCD.

        <h2>Who should invest in the NPS? </h2>
        <p class="eqfont2">
        The NPS is a good scheme for anyone who wants to plan for their retirement early on and has a 
        low-risk appetite. A regular pension (income) in your retirement years will no doubt be a boon,
         especially for those individuals who retire from private-sector jobs. 
            <br><br>
            A systematic investment like this can make a massive difference to your life post-retirement. 
            In fact, Salaried people who want to make the most of the 80C deductions can also consider this scheme.

           <h2>Benefits of NPS</h2><br>
           <h3>Returns/Interest</h3><br>
           <p class="eqfont2">
           A portion of the NPS goes to equities (this may not offer guaranteed returns). However, it offers returns 
           that are much higher than other traditional tax-saving investments like the PPF. <br><br>

           This scheme has been in effect for over a decade, and so far has delivered 8% to 10% annualised returns. 
           In NPS, you are also allowed the option to change your fund manager if you are not happy with the
            performance of the fund.
