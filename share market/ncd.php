    <h2 >What is NCD ?</h2>
   <p class="eqfont">
   Non-convertible debentures(NCDs) are a financial instrument that is used by companies to raise long-term capital. 
   This is done through a public issue.
    <br><br>
    NCDs are a debt instrument with a fixed tenure and people who invest in these receive regular interest at a certain rate.
</p>
<br><br><br>
        <h2>Why is it called non-convertible ? </h2>
        <p class="eqfont2">
        Some debentures can be converted into shares after a certain point in time. This is done at the discretion of the owner. However, this is not possible in the case of NCDs. 
        Thatâ€™s why they are known as non-convertible.

           <h2>1. High interest rates</h2><br>
           <p class="eqfont2">
           The rate of return on NCDs is around 11-12%. This is high compared to most investment options. 
           For example, fixed deposits (FDs) are another popular avenue where people put their money for 
           regular returns. However, the returns are much lower.<br><br>
           There are various interest payout options including monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annual payments.
            The maturity period for an NCD can be anywhere between 90 days to 20 years. This gives you the flexibility
             to choose between short and long tenures based on your investment goals.
           </p>


           <h2>2. Liquidity </h2>
          <p class="eqfont2"> Since they are listed on the stock exchanges, NCDs are easy to withdraw.
               Redeeming your NCD investment may be a little tougher than selling regular stocks, but they 
               are more liquid than bank fixed deposits.
